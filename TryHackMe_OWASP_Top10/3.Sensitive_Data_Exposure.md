# [Severity 3] Sensitive Data Exposure

## Description
Sensitive data exposure occurs when applications fail to protect sensitive information properly, making it susceptible to unauthorized access. This could include confidential information like passwords, credit card numbers, API keys, session tokens, or personal details, which, if exposed, can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and privacy violations.

## Exploitation Method

1. **Inspect Data Transmission Security**:
   - **Why It Matters**: Data sent over an unencrypted channel (like HTTP instead of HTTPS) can be intercepted and read by anyone with access to the network, such as attackers on public Wi-Fi networks.
   - **Approach**: Use tools like Burp Suite, Wireshark, or Fiddler to intercept network traffic and inspect how sensitive data is transmitted between the client and server.
   - **Steps**:
     - Configure Burp Suite or Wireshark to capture network packets and initiate interactions like logging in or making transactions.
     - Analyze the HTTP headers and content to check if credentials, session tokens, or personal information are sent over HTTP (unencrypted) instead of HTTPS (encrypted).
   - *Example*: During login, if a site uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, the attacker can intercept traffic with a tool like Wireshark to read usernames and passwords in plaintext, capturing them without detection.

2. **Access Data Storage Locations**:
   - **Why It Matters**: Sensitive data, if stored insecurely on the client-side (like in cookies, local storage, or session storage) or server-side (like unencrypted databases or log files), is easily accessible to attackers. This can lead to data leaks or privilege escalation.
   - **Approach**: Check local storage on the browser, cookies, and server file systems where data might be stored insecurely.
   - **Steps**:
     - Open Developer Tools in the browser (usually accessible via F12), and inspect the `Application` tab for local storage, session storage, or cookies.
     - Look for sensitive information like session tokens, user IDs, or even passwords stored in plaintext.
     - For server-side storage, assess file permissions on directories that may store sensitive files or logs. Sometimes, old backup files or log files may contain sensitive information like API keys or passwords.
   - *Example*: If a website stores the user's session token in local storage without encryption, an attacker with access to the browser could steal it, allowing them to hijack the session. 

3. **Analyze API Responses for Data Leakage**:
   - **Why It Matters**: APIs may inadvertently include sensitive data in responses, often because of improper access control or lack of filtering. Attackers can leverage this information to access confidential data or gain insights about the system.
   - **Approach**: Use API testing tools like Postman, Burp Suite, or directly intercept API calls to review responses for any unintended sensitive information.
   - **Steps**:
     - Intercept API responses using Burp Suite or Postman while performing actions such as retrieving user profiles, managing accounts, or making transactions.
     - Check JSON or XML responses for sensitive fields like `email`, `phone`, `credit_card`, `SSN`, or `user_role`.
     - Test lower-privilege accounts to see if they receive the same detailed responses, which might indicate improper access control.
   - *Example*: If a user profile API endpoint (`/api/users/profile`) returns sensitive data like email, address, or even hashed passwords, an attacker can exploit this by programmatically collecting this information. Even though hashed, this data can still be used in further attacks or leaked.

## Mitigation Techniques

- **Encrypt Data in Transit and at Rest**:
   - Use **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** for all data in transit, ensuring HTTPS is enforced on all pages, especially where sensitive data is exchanged. Implement **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** headers to prevent HTTP fallback.
   - Encrypt data stored on servers (data at rest) using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256). Apply encryption to databases, file storage, and backups to ensure sensitive data is protected even if the database is compromised.

- **Minimize Data Storage and Retention**:
   - Store only the minimum amount of sensitive data necessary for functionality. Regularly delete outdated or unused data to limit exposure.
   - Implement **Data Masking** for non-essential data storage in APIs, replacing sensitive information with masked or obfuscated data (e.g., showing only the last 4 digits of a credit card).

- **Secure API Design**:
   - Avoid exposing sensitive fields in API responses unless necessary. Use **parameterized APIs** to limit the data fields returned based on user permissions.
   - Validate access control for all API endpoints to prevent data leaks, ensuring that lower-privileged accounts cannot access confidential information.
   - Implement **rate-limiting** and **logging** on APIs to detect and prevent automated attacks aimed at collecting data.
