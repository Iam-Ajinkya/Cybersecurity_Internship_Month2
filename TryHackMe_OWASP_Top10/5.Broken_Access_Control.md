# [Severity 5] Broken Access Control

## Description
Broken access control occurs when an application doesn’t properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users or even unauthorized users can do. This could allow attackers to view or modify data that should be inaccessible to them, escalate privileges, or perform unauthorized actions. Broken access control vulnerabilities are common in applications that do not strictly enforce server-side checks on user permissions or improperly validate access permissions.

## Exploitation Method

### 1. **Test Direct Object References (IDOR - Insecure Direct Object Reference)**:
   - **Overview**: IDOR vulnerabilities occur when an application directly references sensitive objects (e.g., files, database records) in a way that users can manipulate. By altering object identifiers in URLs or request parameters, attackers may gain unauthorized access to data belonging to other users.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Identify URL Parameters or Request Parameters**: Look for URLs or form requests that include unique identifiers for resources (e.g., `user_id`, `account_no`, or `file_id`).
     2. **Modify the Identifier**: Change the identifier to one associated with another user or resource.
     3. **Observe the Response**: If the application returns data for another user without validation, it confirms IDOR.
   - **Example**:
     - URL: `https://example.com/profile?user_id=123`
     - By changing `user_id=123` to `user_id=124`, an attacker might view another user's profile data if access control is not enforced.

### 2. **Attempt Forced Browsing**:
   - **Overview**: Forced browsing is a technique where attackers try to access restricted directories, files, or endpoints directly, bypassing the application’s intended navigation. This is often attempted on URLs that might be protected only by obscurity (i.e., not accessible through the UI but still accessible if the URL is known).
   - **Steps**:
     1. **List Sensitive URLs or Directories**: Common examples include URLs like `/admin`, `/backup`, `/config`, or `/settings`.
     2. **Directly Access the URL**: Manually enter the URL in the browser or intercept and modify requests in tools like Burp Suite.
     3. **Check for Unauthorized Access**: If the application allows access to the restricted URL without proper authentication or role validation, it indicates broken access control.
   - **Example**:
     - Attempting to access `https://example.com/admin` without being an admin or navigating to `/config/backup.zip` to download sensitive configuration files.

### 3. **Manipulate API Requests**:
   - **Overview**: APIs often receive requests that include user permissions or roles, but if the server does not verify these roles properly, attackers can modify the API request to escalate privileges or access restricted data.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Identify Role or Permission Parameters**: Look for request parameters or headers that specify a user’s role or access level, such as `role=user`, `role=admin`, or permissions arrays.
     2. **Modify the Request**: Use an intercepting tool like Burp Suite to change `role=user` to `role=admin`.
     3. **Check for Unauthorized Actions**: If the server accepts the modified role without verification, you may gain access to restricted functions.
   - **Example**:
     - An API request like `POST /api/v1/deleteUser` with headers specifying `role=user` can be modified to `role=admin`, allowing an attacker to delete other users.

### 4. **Parameter Tampering in Web Forms**:
   - **Overview**: Web forms often contain hidden fields that control actions or permissions. If these fields are not properly validated on the server, attackers can manipulate them.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Identify Hidden Form Fields**: Inspect form fields for hidden parameters (e.g., `<input type="hidden" name="admin" value="false">`).
     2. **Modify the Value of Hidden Fields**: Change `value="false"` to `value="true"` in an attempt to escalate privileges or access restricted actions.
     3. **Observe Results**: If the application processes the modified hidden value without validation, it suggests broken access control.
   - **Example**:
     - A form with a hidden field like `<input type="hidden" name="is_admin" value="0">` could be changed to `value="1"` to gain unauthorized administrative access.

### 5. **Privilege Escalation via Unprotected Endpoints**:
   - **Overview**: Some applications have endpoints intended only for users with specific privileges. However, if these endpoints lack access checks, any user can access them and perform privileged actions.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Identify Potentially Privileged Endpoints**: Look for endpoints related to sensitive actions, like `/editUser`, `/deleteUser`, or `/createAdmin`.
     2. **Test Access Without Elevated Privileges**: As a low-privilege user, attempt to access these endpoints directly.
     3. **Check for Privileged Actions**: If the endpoint allows access without verifying privileges, it indicates broken access control.
   - **Example**:
     - A user without administrative rights being able to access `https://example.com/editUser?user_id=123` and edit another user’s details.

## Mitigation Techniques

1. **Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Clearly define roles within the application (e.g., `user`, `editor`, `admin`) and assign permissions based on these roles.
   - Implement server-side checks that restrict access based on the assigned role, ensuring no unauthorized users can perform sensitive actions.

2. **Implement Server-Side Authorization Checks**:
   - Never rely on client-side controls (e.g., UI restrictions, hidden form fields) to enforce access restrictions, as these can be easily bypassed.
   - Ensure every request is validated server-side, confirming that the user has the correct permissions to access the requested resource.

3. **Use Object-Level Security Controls**:
   - For APIs, enforce object-level security to validate access based on each object’s ownership. For example, when accessing a user’s data, the server should validate that the requesting user is the owner of that data.
   - Implement strict validation rules that match the user’s access level to the requested object.

4. **Audit and Regularly Review Privileges**:
   - Periodically review and audit permissions to ensure they remain appropriate, especially for users with elevated privileges.
   - Regularly test and monitor for access control vulnerabilities using tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or automated vulnerability scanners.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Log any access attempt on sensitive resources, including access attempts to restricted areas or unauthorized attempts to alter data.
   - Monitor logs to detect patterns of access control abuse or repeated unauthorized access attempts, allowing for quicker incident response.

By rigorously enforcing server-side access checks, utilizing role-based access control, and continuously monitoring for irregular access patterns, applications can minimize the risk of broken access control vulnerabilities and protect sensitive user data.
