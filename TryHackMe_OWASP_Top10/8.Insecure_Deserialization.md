# [Severity 8] Insecure Deserialization

## Description
Insecure deserialization occurs when an application accepts serialized data from an untrusted source and does not properly validate or sanitize this data before deserializing it. Deserialization is the process of converting a serialized format (like JSON, XML, or binary) back into an object. When an application fails to check the integrity and authenticity of this data, attackers can manipulate serialized objects to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or even cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.

### Common Scenarios
- **Web Applications**: Many web applications store user session data as serialized objects in cookies or databases, making them prime targets.
- **APIs**: When APIs accept serialized input from clients, attackers can craft malicious payloads that can exploit vulnerable deserialization processes.

### Impacts
- **Remote Code Execution**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Data Breach**: Malicious payloads could be designed to extract sensitive data from the application or database.
- **Service Disruption**: Attackers may exploit deserialization flaws to crash services, causing downtime.

## Exploitation Method

1. **Identify Serialized Objects in Data**:
   - Attackers look for data that could be deserialized. This includes cookies, request parameters, or data payloads in API calls.
   - **Example**: Consider a web application that stores user sessions in cookies. An encoded cookie might look like this: 
     ```
     cookie=eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ==
     ```
     After decoding using Base64, you might see:
     ```json
     {"user":"admin"}
     ```
     This indicates that the user has admin privileges. If the application does not validate this data upon deserialization, an attacker could potentially modify the cookie to elevate their privileges.

2. **Decode and Modify Serialized Data**:
   - Use tools like **Burp Suite** or **CyberChef** to intercept requests and decode serialized data.
   - **Example**: If the serialized data looks like this when decoded:
     ```json
     {"role":"guest"}
     ```
     The attacker can modify it to:
     ```json
     {"role":"admin"}
     ```
     Upon deserialization, the application might mistakenly grant the user administrative access.

3. **Inject Malicious Payloads Using Serialized Objects**:
   - If the application uses vulnerable libraries for deserialization (e.g., Java's `ObjectInputStream`), attackers can create malicious payloads that execute harmful actions.
   - **Example**: An attacker crafts a Java object that executes a command. The serialized data could be manipulated to include a payload that triggers the execution of a system command when deserialized:
     ```java
     Runtime.getRuntime().exec("whoami");
     ```
     If the application deserializes this object without proper checks, the command is executed on the server.

4. **Test for Command Execution**:
   - Attackers can use tools like **ysoserial** to create complex payloads that can exploit deserialization flaws.
   - **Example**: Using `ysoserial`, the attacker generates a payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary commands on the server. The command could be injected into a parameter expected to hold serialized data. If the application does not perform validation, the payload gets executed:
     ```bash
     java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections5 'whoami'
     ```
     The attacker sends this payload in the serialized format to the server, leading to the execution of the command.

### Testing for Insecure Deserialization:
- **Set Up a Test Environment**: Create a lab environment with a vulnerable application that uses serialization.
- **Use Debugging Tools**: Use debuggers or interceptors to monitor the deserialization process and test various payloads to observe application behavior.
- **Simulate Attacks**: Craft malicious payloads and send them to the application, checking for unexpected behavior or command execution.

## Mitigation Techniques

- **Use Secure Serialization Methods**: Opt for serialization frameworks that provide security features. Avoid using default serializers, as they may not validate data properly.
  - Example: Use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for securely transmitting information as JSON objects instead of custom serialization formats.

- **Implement Signature Checks**: Add digital signatures or checksums to serialized objects. This allows the application to verify data integrity before deserializing it.
  - Example: When a serialized object is created, compute a hash of the object, and store this hash alongside the object. Upon deserialization, compare the computed hash against the stored hash.

- **Limit Deserialized Data Types**: Implement strict whitelisting of classes that can be deserialized. By restricting the types of objects that can be deserialized, you reduce the risk of executing malicious payloads.
  - Example: Instead of deserializing any class, specify only those classes that are necessary for the applicationâ€™s functionality.

- **Validate Input Data**: Before deserialization, perform input validation to ensure the data adheres to expected formats. This includes length checks, type checks, and structure validation.
  - Example: Ensure that a serialized object is of an expected class type before attempting to deserialize it.

- **Monitor and Log Deserialization Events**: Keep detailed logs of deserialization actions. Monitor for unusual activity that might indicate exploitation attempts.
  - Example: Log whenever deserialization occurs, especially when it involves user-provided data.
