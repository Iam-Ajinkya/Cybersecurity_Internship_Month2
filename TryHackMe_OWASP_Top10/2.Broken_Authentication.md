# [Severity 2] Broken Authentication

## Description
Broken authentication vulnerabilities arise when an application’s authentication mechanism is improperly implemented, allowing attackers to bypass login protections and access other users' accounts. Common causes include weak password policies, insecure session management, and flaws in multi-factor authentication or password recovery processes. Exploiting these weaknesses enables attackers to impersonate legitimate users, escalate privileges, or perform unauthorized actions.

## Exploitation Method

### 1. **Weak Password Exploitation**
   - **Brute-Force Attacks**: Attackers use automated tools to rapidly guess passwords by trying numerous combinations, relying on users with weak or common passwords.
   - **Dictionary Attacks**: Instead of random guesses, attackers try passwords from a list of common or previously breached passwords, targeting users likely to use simple passwords.
   - **Example**: Suppose a site lacks rate limiting on login attempts. An attacker could use a tool like Hydra or Burp Suite Intruder to rapidly try common passwords (e.g., `123456`, `password`, `qwerty`) against multiple accounts.
   - **How It’s Done**:
     1. Identify the login form endpoint by observing the login request with tools like Burp Suite or by inspecting the network requests in the browser.
     2. Use a tool like Hydra or Burp Suite Intruder to repeatedly send login requests with different passwords from a dictionary file.
     3. Monitor the responses: if one returns a successful login message, the password has been cracked.

### 2. **Session Token Manipulation**
   - **Predictable or Insecure Session Tokens**: If an application uses session tokens that follow a predictable pattern or are not randomized, attackers may be able to guess or manipulate them to access other users’ sessions.
   - **Session Fixation**: If a system doesn’t regenerate session tokens upon login, an attacker may trick a user into authenticating with a pre-set token, giving the attacker access to their session.
   - **Example**: Suppose a website uses sequential session tokens like `session=1001`, `session=1002`, etc. An attacker could attempt to modify their token to access another user’s session.
   - **How It’s Done**:
     1. After logging in as a regular user, intercept the session token in the request (e.g., `session=12345`).
     2. Change the session token to a similar or sequential token (e.g., `session=12344`) to see if it allows access to another user’s session.
     3. If successful, this demonstrates a session prediction vulnerability.
   - **Tools Used**: Burp Suite, Postman, browser developer tools.

### 3. **Flawed Authentication Flow**
   - **Password Recovery Weaknesses**: Attackers often exploit weak password recovery flows where security questions are predictable, allowing them to reset passwords without the actual user’s knowledge.
   - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass**: In some cases, flaws in the implementation of 2FA can allow attackers to bypass it. For instance, if the application doesn’t validate 2FA tokens properly, attackers can exploit this to log in without the second factor.
   - **Example**: If an application allows unlimited password reset attempts, attackers may use common answers to security questions or even social engineering to reset an account password.
   - **How It’s Done**:
     1. Locate the password recovery page and inspect the reset mechanism.
     2. Test if the application uses weak or common security questions that are easy to guess.
     3. Alternatively, use social engineering to try and answer the security questions based on public information about the target user.
     4. For 2FA bypasses, monitor the login flow and try accessing the account after bypassing the 2FA page if improper validation is detected.
   - **Tools Used**: Burp Suite, browser developer tools.

## Mitigation Techniques
- **Enforce Strong Password Policies**: Require passwords to meet specific criteria (e.g., minimum 12 characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols) and prevent users from choosing commonly breached passwords. Regularly audit password policies to keep up with evolving security standards.
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA, which requires users to provide an additional verification factor (e.g., one-time code from an authenticator app) beyond their password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.
- **Implement Secure Session Management**: Use secure, randomly generated session tokens that are difficult to predict. Ensure session tokens are transmitted only over HTTPS, regenerate tokens upon user login, and enforce session timeouts after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized reuse.
