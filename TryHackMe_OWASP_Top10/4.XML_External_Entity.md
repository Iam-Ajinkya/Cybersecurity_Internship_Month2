# [Severity 4] XML External Entity (XXE)

## Description
XML External Entity (XXE) attacks occur when a web application parses XML input that includes a reference to an external entity. If the XML parser is not securely configured, an attacker can manipulate this input to access sensitive local files, interact with internal network resources, or even trigger denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. XXE vulnerabilities are common in applications that use XML to handle input, especially when they allow user-supplied XML.

## Exploitation Method

1. **Injecting XML External Entities**:
   - Begin by finding points in the application where XML data is processed, such as API endpoints, file upload forms, or XML configuration interfaces. Once identified, test for XXE by injecting custom XML payloads.
   - **Example Payload**:
      ```xml
      <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
      <data>&xxe;</data>
      ```
      In this payload:
      - `<!DOCTYPE foo [...]>`: Defines a custom Document Type Definition (DTD) with an external entity.
      - `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`: Creates an external entity (`xxe`) that points to the `/etc/passwd` file, commonly targeted on UNIX systems to reveal system user information.
      - `<data>&xxe;</data>`: Injects the `xxe` entity into the XML body, prompting the XML parser to fetch and include the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
   
   - **Testing Process**:
      - Send this payload to the identified XML processing point using tools like **Burp Suite** or **Postman**.
      - Observe the response to check if the contents of `/etc/passwd` are returned, indicating a successful read access.

2. **Targeting Local or Internal Resources**:
   - XXE can be used to interact with internal network resources or perform additional file system exploration if the target system allows it.
   - **Example Payload to Probe Internal Network**:
      ```xml
      <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://127.0.0.1:8080"> ]>
      <data>&xxe;</data>
      ```
      In this payload:
      - `http://127.0.0.1:8080` could target an internal web server or application. If successful, this can confirm the existence of a service on the specified port.
      - Try different local IP addresses and ports based on common internal services (e.g., `http://192.168.1.1:80`).
   
   - **Expanded Access to Other Internal Files**:
      - You can try paths like `file:///c:/Windows/win.ini` on Windows or `file:///etc/hosts` on UNIX systems to confirm if other internal files are readable.

3. **DoS Attacks via XML Bombs**:
   - XXE vulnerabilities can also facilitate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by overwhelming the XML parser. An “XML bomb” is a type of payload that expands exponentially when parsed, leading to resource exhaustion.
   - **Billion Laughs Attack Payload**:
      ```xml
      <!DOCTYPE lolz [
      <!ENTITY lol "lol">
      <!ENTITY lol2 "&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;">
      <!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;">
      <!ENTITY lol4 "&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;">
      ]>
      <lolz>&lol4;</lolz>
      ```
      This payload uses recursive entity expansion to create an XML bomb. When the parser attempts to process it, each nested entity exponentially multiplies the data, which can lead to server crashes or extreme slowdown.

4. **Observing XML Parsing Error Messages**:
   - Sometimes, the XML parser may reveal useful information in error messages if the injected payload is not fully processed but partially parsed. These errors might indicate the presence of XML entities or restricted access paths.
   - **Testing**:
      - If a specific file or network resource is inaccessible, the XML parser may return an error message indicating permission restrictions or network unavailability, providing hints about the environment.

## Mitigation Techniques

- **Disable External Entity Processing**:
   - Instruct the XML parser to ignore external entities by setting secure configurations. For example, in Java:
     ```java
     DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
     dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
     ```
     Disabling `DOCTYPE` declarations prevents the parser from processing external entities altogether.

- **Use Secure Libraries**:
   - Choose XML parsers and libraries that are configured securely by default, such as the `lxml` library in Python or JSON as a format alternative to XML.

- **Switch to JSON for User-Supplied Data**:
   - When possible, avoid XML for data that will be user-supplied. JSON, while not immune to every type of injection, is generally safer against XXE because it does not support external entities by design.

These steps provide insight into how attackers may attempt to exploit XXE vulnerabilities, and implementing strong security configurations can mitigate these risks effectively.
