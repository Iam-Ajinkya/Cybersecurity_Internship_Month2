# TryHackMe - OWASP Top 10

Welcome to the **TryHackMe - OWASP Top 10** directory! This repository contains documentation and findings from completing various TryHackMe labs focused on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized list of the most critical security risks to web applications, providing a framework for understanding common vulnerabilities.

## Directory Contents

This directory includes the following markdown files, each dedicated to one of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:

- [01.Injection.md](01.Injection.md): Details on injection vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and mitigation techniques.
- [02.Broken_Authentication.md](02.Broken_Authentication.md): Information on broken authentication issues and strategies to secure applications.
- [03.Sensitive_Data_Exposure.md](03.Sensitive_Data_Exposure.md): Overview of sensitive data exposure risks and best practices for protection.
- [04.XML_External_Entity.md](04.XML_External_Entity.md): Explanation of XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.
- [05.Broken_Access_Control.md](05.Broken_Access_Control.md): Discussion on broken access control vulnerabilities and ways to enforce access restrictions.
- [06.Security_Misconfiguration.md](06.Security_Misconfiguration.md): Insights into security misconfigurations and recommendations for secure setups.
- [07.Cross_Site_Scripting.md](07.Cross_Site_Scripting.md): Comprehensive details on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and their mitigation.
- [08.Insecure_Deserialization.md](08.Insecure_Deserialization.md): Overview of insecure deserialization risks and protective measures.
- [09.Components_With_Known_Vulnerabilities.md](09.Components_With_Known_Vulnerabilities.md): Information on using components with known vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
- [10.Insufficient_Logging_and_Monitoring.md](10.Insufficient_Logging_and_Monitoring.md): Insights into the importance of logging and monitoring in securing applications.

## Purpose

The goal of this directory is to summarize and document the knowledge gained through practical labs, making it easier to understand and implement security measures against these common vulnerabilities. By exploring each vulnerability, we aim to enhance our skills in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating these risks effectively.

Feel free to explore the individual markdown files for detailed information on each vulnerability!
