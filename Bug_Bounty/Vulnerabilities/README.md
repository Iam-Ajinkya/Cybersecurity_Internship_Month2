# Vulnerabilities

## Overview

This directory is reserved for documenting vulnerabilities identified during the bug bounty assessment. Typically, each identified vulnerability would be documented here with a detailed description, steps to reproduce, impact analysis, and suggested mitigation steps. However, due to responsible disclosure guidelines, the specific findings are kept confidential to maintain the integrity and security of the affected platform.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

In line with responsible disclosure policies:

- **All findings must remain confidential** until the vulnerabilities are effectively mitigated by the platform’s security team.
- **No information is to be shared with third parties** prior to remediation. Sharing these details too soon could compromise the security of the platform and violate ethical standards in cybersecurity.

Due to these policies, **I am unable to share specific findings with anyone outside the platform's security team.** Adhering to these guidelines ensures that security concerns are handled professionally and in a way that protects both users and the platform.

### Current Directory Status

As per the responsible disclosure agreement, this directory currently includes only this `README.md` file and **no additional content or vulnerability details**. Once mitigations are confirmed, additional documentation may be provided if permitted by the platform’s guidelines.

Thank you for your understanding of these security practices and for respecting the confidentiality required in this process. This approach allows us to work together responsibly to improve cybersecurity without introducing unnecessary risks.
