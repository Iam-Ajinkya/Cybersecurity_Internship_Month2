# Reconnaissance Directory

Welcome to the **Reconnaissance** directory! This is where our journey into understanding the target begins. In this phase, we've gathered essential data that gives us a clear picture of the target’s online footprint and any potential entry points. Think of it as setting the foundation for all the exciting, in-depth testing to come!

Every file and subdirectory here holds valuable information about the target’s network, services, and public exposure, providing us with insights we can leverage in the later stages of our assessment.
